# Java ChatBot

This is a simple Java-based ChatBot that interacts with users through the console. The bot can perform various tasks, such as guessing the user's age, counting to a specified number, and running a basic knowledge quiz.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: The bot interacts with the user via the console.
- **Age Guessing**: The bot calculates the user's age based on the remainders of their age when divided by 3, 5, and 7.
- **Counting**: The bot counts from 0 to a number specified by the user.
- **Knowledge Quiz**: The bot runs a basic programming knowledge quiz.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several classes, each with a single responsibility:

- **`ChatBot`**: Coordinates the program flow.
- **`UserInteraction`**: Handles user input and output.
- **`AgeCalculator`**: Calculates the user's age.
- **`KnowledgeTest`**: Manages the knowledge quiz.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed on your system.
- **Development Environment**: You can use any Java-compatible IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.) or simply a text editor and the command line.
